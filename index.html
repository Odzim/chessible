                    <h2>Movement of the pieces</h2>
                    <h4>Pawns</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move forward one square, but capture diagonally.</li>
                        <li>On their first move, pawns have the option to move forward two squares.</li>
                        <li>Pawns promote to any other piece upon reaching the opponent's back rank.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Rooks</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move horizontally or vertically any number of squares.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Knights</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move in an "L" shape, either two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and two squares perpendicular. Knights can jump over other pieces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Bishops</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move diagonally any number of squares.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Queens</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine the movements of rooks and bishops, moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Kings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move one square in any direction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Some <span>special</span> moves</h3>  
                    <h4>Castling</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A special move involving the king and a rook. It allows the king to move two squares towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square the king skipped.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>En Passant</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pawn capturing rule. If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position, and lands beside an opponent's pawn, that opponent's pawn can capture it as if it only moved one square forward.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Some <span>special</span> rules!</h3>
                    <h4>Check</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A king is in check if it is attacked by an opponent's piece. The player must make a move to get out of check.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Checkmate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a player's king is in check and there is no legal move to remove the threat, it is checkmate and the game is over.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <h4>Stalemate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a player has no legal moves and their king is not in check, it's a stalemate. The game is a draw.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <h4>Draws</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are various ways a game can end in a draw, such as by agreement, threefold repetition, the fifty-move rule, or insufficient material.</li>
