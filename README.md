### Features Left to Implement

- Interactive game board

## Testing 

Done multiple tests with multiple different commits as I was either unhappy with the result, or another idea came to mind. I've tried making it work across multiple devices and different browsers. It works over opera gx and chrome. It seems responsive across mobile devices although optimization could be better.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://github.com/Odzim/chessible/blob/main/media/proof%201.png)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://github.com/Odzim/chessible/blob/main/media/proof%202.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

The nav bar doesnt' stretch across the whole bottom side of the page
